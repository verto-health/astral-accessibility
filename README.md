# Astral Accessibility: Open Source Accessibility Widget

![Astral Accessibility](docs/astral.png)

# Astral is in alpha

Astral is currently in an alpha phase. You can use it today with much of its feature set implemented, but it's a few features shy, along with some general polishing away from a 1.x release.

# Overview

Astral Accessibility is an open source accessibility widget that can be easily embedded to any website. It provides a set of
accessibility features that can be used by people with accessibility needs to improve their experience on the web. Read why we
started this project [here](blue.verto.health/advancing-accessibility-with-astral/).

## Features

- Screen Reader (text to speech)
- Contrast
- Saturation
- Text Size
- Text Spacing
- More to come!

## Usage

Astral is built with Angular Elements. You can use it in your website in under 30 seconds. To add it, simply include the Javascript and initialize it:

```html
<script src="https://astral-accessibility.pages.dev/main.js"></script>
<script>
  initializeAstral();
</script>
```

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:verto-health/astral-accessibility.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
$ yarn install
```

3. Run the development server and visit `http://localhost:8000`

```bash
$ yarn run start:demo
```

This will watch for changes and automatically reload when you make changes in both Angular and the demo app under `projects/demo`.

### Running E2E Tests With Cypress

After running the steps above, you will have access to the Cypress test suite. To run Cypress locally, run the following command in your terminal

```
$ yarn cypress open
```

Choose E2E Testing, and select a browser to start running the Specs

## Feature Development

### State Saving

Astral supports state saving, meaning keys are saved to localStorage to save the user's configuration of the tool. When developing new features to add in state saving you can follow a similar setup to existing widgets.

1. Import the Parent class for all features:

```js
import { AccessibilityComponent } from "./accessibility.component";
```

2. Inhert Parent class properties, call `super()` in new constructor, and set the current state:
   Note: We prefix the key to be set with `astralAccessibility_` to not clash with user's localStorage

```js
export class <newComponent> extends AccessibilityComponent {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.currentState = super.setLogic("astralAccessibility_<newFeatureState>");
  ...
  }
}
```

3. Initialize current state to get from the localStorage:

```js
currentState = super.getState("astralAccessibility_<newFeatureState>");
```

4. In the `nextState()` function use the Parent `changeState(currentState, localStorageKey, numOfStates)` function:

```js
this.currentState = super.changeState(
  this.currentState,
  "astralAccessibility_<newFeatureState>",
  this.states.length,
);
```

5. The Child class function `_runStateLogic()` function should override the Parent class

```js
protected override _runStateLogic(){
    ...
}
```
